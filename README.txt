Comments by sandip about code
===========================
1) I will give 3 out of 5 to code.

2) Major drawback of the code I have found is it is using Database operation in foreach loop in many place.
this will result slow execution time of query. It try to run query as many time as total records in foreach loop.
We can achieve same results in minimum query and execution time using proper joining and multi dimentional array use.

3) Good thing about code that most of the codes achieved through laravel concepts
like repository pattern, events, notification etc..

=================================


Choose ONE of the following tasks.
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo.

1, A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting. Logic.. 

2.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses.  

Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 

NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc
